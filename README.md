Once you past into the appropriate worksheets the three financial statements for a company, simply change the company name in the top left corner and Excel will automatically populate all other market data to easily and quickly construct a valuation for the company.

As it is easier to show how the spreadsheet works with an example, the spreadsheet that I included contains a potential valuation for General Dynamics (Ticker: GD) which trades on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE)

DISLCAIMER: The contents of this spreadsheet and any information contained therein do no constitute financial advice.
